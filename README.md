# GuessMyNumber

Second project in JS after just starting with learning javascript and WebDev.

The idea of the project was to create a miniature game with eventlisteners, guessing the number and basic DOM manipulation exercise.

In the app.js file, there are separators included in order to easily look over the code and what every instance of it does.

Included are the functions to display messages, modify the background color and restart the game with reusable highscore value (until complete reboot of the website).

Included are the limits of what values are permitted and invalid. 

This project was instructed as very basic DOM manipulation exercise and as an additional lessons in DOM manipulation in order to deepen javascript knowledge.

Code is reusable by anyone. Open to additional suggestions regarding code usage/better coding with DRY principle in mind.

This is the English version of the minigame and it does not include writing streamlined code in order with the DRY principle. That code is included in the separate folder named SLO.
